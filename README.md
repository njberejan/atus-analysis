# ATUS Analysis

This is the repository for the ATUS Analysis assignment for The Iron Yard in Durham, NC.

The purpose of this assignment was to use pandas to organize and analyze data from a disparate number of source files, all provided via the US Census conducted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (http://www.bls.gov/).

Please find my results in the Jupyter Notebook file entitled "census_data" where you will find my thought process and data management via pandas notated with step-by-step instructions. You will find a summation of findings at the bottom of the notebook. Requirements for viewing the graphs as they are intended (via seaborn) are listed in the requirements.txt file.
