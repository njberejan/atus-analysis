This is the README file for the US Census information homework assigned for this weekend. Please find my results in the Jupyter Notebook file entitled "census_data" where you will find my thought process and data management via pandas notated with step-by-step instructions. You will find a summation of findings at the bottom of the notebook. Requirements for viewing the graphs as they are intended (via seaborn) are listed in the requirements.txt file.
